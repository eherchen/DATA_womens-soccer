            <p>This model shows the profile location for the captured tweets.  Only a small percentage of tweets are geo-tagged; tweets must be resolved to their authors so that author profiles can be queried for locations. During the data cleaning stages, fake locations are discarded to plot tweeter (claimed) locations. This results in a small dataset compared to the mass of tweets.  </p>

            <p><i>There appears to be a correlation between profiles with obviously fake locations (such as "Nowheresville, USA," "The Moon", and "Your Mom's House") and extremely negative sentiment, suggesting that anonymity in social media may contribute to a toxic culture.</i></p>
