Notice the Competing Headlines:

> New US Soccer fact sheet eviscerates Megan Rapinoe’s ‘equal pay’ narrative

And here is the [NY Times headline](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/sports/soccer/us-soccer-equal-pay.html) from a day earlier: 

> U.S. Soccer Says It Pays Women’s Team More Than Men’s Team
