    <h1>Sentiment Over Time</h1>

<div class="container">
        <p>Sentiment Analysis is the process of extracting specific words from text in an attempt to identify the writer's tone or attitude towards a given topic. This technique is becoming increasingly popular in the social media era, where writers contribute their opinions publickly and freely.   Noise words (such as if, the, and, or) are stripped out and the remaining words are lemmatized (processed through their variants, such as run/running/ran or dog/dogs), counted, mapped, and weighted then compared to a previously-evaluated sample, and a final grade is assigned. </p>

        </div>

        <p>These plots compare counts of positive, negative and neutral tweets regarding the USWNT and the USMNT from days near and during their respective World Cup tournaments.  Tweets were captured, cleaned, processed, inventoried, and plotted to expose sentiment trends as well as overall volume. Interestingly, the negative sentiment surrounding the USWNT increases after each won round, with a final and significant spike in negative sentiment as the team wins the Championship round; the negative sentiment level falls the next day but never returns to its original levels during the sample period. This is in contrast to the USMNT, whose negative sentiment remains fairly consistent throughout their tournament, spiking moderately as the team loses in the Championship round, then falls quickly to its original levels. </p>
